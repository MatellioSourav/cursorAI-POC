**Database Correctness & Constraints:**
- **CRITICAL**: Flag missing database constraints and optimizations
- Check for missing indexes on frequently queried columns (especially in WHERE clauses)
- Flag UPDATE/DELETE queries without WHERE clauses (prevents accidental mass updates)
- Verify transaction boundaries for multi-step database operations
- Check for missing foreign key constraints (if schema context available)
- Flag queries that could cause data integrity issues
- Verify proper use of database transactions for atomic operations
- Check for missing unique constraints on columns that should be unique
- Flag N+1 query problems
- Verify proper connection pooling usage
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (parameterized queries)
- Verify transaction management is correct
- Flag queries that fetch unnecessary data (SELECT *)
