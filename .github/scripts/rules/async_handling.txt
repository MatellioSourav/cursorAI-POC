**Promises & Async Handling:**
- **CRITICAL**: Proper async/await and promise handling
- Node.js:
  * Flag wrapping synchronous logic inside new Promise() (unnecessary)
  * Use async/await consistently (avoid mixing with .then())
  * Flag sequential await calls in loops when parallel execution is safe (use Promise.all)
  * Always handle Promise rejections (missing .catch() or try/catch)
  * Flag unhandled promise rejections
- FastAPI/Python:
  * Use async endpoints only when I/O-bound operations exist
  * Flag blocking calls inside async routes
  * Ensure DB sessions are properly closed or scoped
  * Verify proper async context management
