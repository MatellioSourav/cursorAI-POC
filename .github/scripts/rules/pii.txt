**Sensitive Data & PII Exposure:**
- **CRITICAL**: Prevent PII and sensitive data exposure in APIs and logs
- Flag unnecessary PII in API responses:
  * Email addresses (unless required)
  * Phone numbers (unless required)
  * PAN numbers (Indian tax ID pattern)
  * Aadhaar numbers (12-digit pattern)
  * Full addresses (unless required)
  * Date of birth
  * Social Security Numbers (SSN patterns)
- Detect and flag sensitive data in logs:
  * Passwords (password, pwd, passwd in log messages)
  * Tokens (token, jwt, access_token, refresh_token)
  * OTP codes (otp, verification[_-]?code)
  * Credit card numbers (pattern detection)
  * PAN/Aadhaar numbers
  * API keys or secrets
- Flag storing secrets in plain text anywhere (database, files, variables)
- Check for sensitive fields in API response objects, log statements, error messages, debug output
- Verify data masking/redaction for sensitive fields in logs
- Flag unnecessary sensitive fields returned in GET responses
