**Testing Requirements:**
- **CRITICAL**: Validate unit tests exist for:
  * Services and business logic
  * API endpoints
  * Critical UI flows/components
- Add integration tests for complex database interactions
- Flag missing test coverage for new functionality
- If business logic changed and no tests were added: ⚠️ WARN explicitly
- Verify test coverage for new functionality
- Check if acceptance criteria are testable
- Flag missing test cases or testability issues
