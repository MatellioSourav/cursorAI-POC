**Error Handling - No Internal Leakage:**
- **CRITICAL**: Ensure error responses don't leak internal system details
- Flag raw exception messages sent to clients (error.message, error.stack)
- Check for stack traces in API responses
- Verify detailed error objects are not exposed to end users
- Flag database error messages exposed to clients (should be sanitized)
- Ensure error responses are user-friendly and don't reveal:
  * Stack traces
  * File paths
  * Database connection strings
  * Internal system architecture
  * Code structure or variable names
- Verify error logging happens server-side (detailed errors in logs, not responses)
- Check for proper error sanitization before sending to client
