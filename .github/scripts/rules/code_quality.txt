**Code Quality:**
- Best practices, clean code principles, maintainability
- Code formatting consistency (indentation, spacing, brackets)
- Validate naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, kebab-case) match project standards
- Verify file organization and structure follows project conventions
- Check import/require ordering and grouping
- Flag inconsistent coding styles across files
- Ensure code follows language-specific style guides (ESLint, Prettier, PEP 8, etc.)
- Flag code duplication that should be extracted into reusable components/services
- Suggest better architectural patterns if applicable
