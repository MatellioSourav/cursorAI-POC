**Performance & Scalability:**
- **CRITICAL**: Flag unbounded loops or recursion risks (missing termination conditions)
- Check for inefficient data structures (using array when Set/Map needed, etc.)
- Flag repeated expensive calls (DB, API, filesystem) that could be cached
- Identify missing caching opportunities for frequently accessed data
- Flag large object creation inside loops (should be created outside)
- Check for memory-intensive operations in loops
- Verify proper use of pagination for large datasets
- Flag database queries inside for loops (use bulk operations instead)
- Prefer bulk inserts, joins, IN queries, and set-based operations
- Flag N+1 query problems (use eager loading or batch queries)
- Verify indexes exist for frequently filtered columns
- Flag sequential await calls in loops when parallel execution is safe
- Check for missing database query optimization
