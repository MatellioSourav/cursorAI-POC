**Observability & Operability:**
- **CRITICAL**: Check for missing or noisy logging (too many logs or no logs at all)
- Verify appropriate log levels are used (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Flag missing correlation IDs / trace IDs for request tracking
- Check for missing metrics for critical paths (success/failure rates, latency)
- Flag missing health checks for new components/services
- Verify feature flags are used for risky changes (not hard-coded)
- Verify structured logging format (JSON, key-value pairs)
- Ensure sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) is NOT logged
- Check log messages are meaningful and include context
- Verify performance-critical operations are logged
- Flag console.log statements in production code (should use proper logger)
- Check logging doesn't create performance bottlenecks
